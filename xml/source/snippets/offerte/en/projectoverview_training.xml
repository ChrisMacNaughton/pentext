  <p>
    <company_short/>
    will provide xxx training sessions, for xxx different groups,
    on-site/off-site at xxx venue, with a maximum of xxx participants per event.
    The training will focus on the top 5 vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10.
  </p>
  <p>As part of this training, <company_short/>
    will also guide the participants through performing security tests on the
    targets described below. This is intended to gain insight into the security
    of these systems. This is done by means of accessing the underlying systems,
    attempting to find vulnerabilities, and gaining further access and elevated
    privileges by exploiting any vulnerabilities found.
  </p>
  <p>Afterwards, <company_short/> will coach the participants in writing a pentest
    report; <client_short/> will start writing the report and <company_short/>
    will complete it.
